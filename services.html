        <p>
            Players crave knowledge and energy for getting them better.
            <br>Coaches are searching for innovative on-court drills and various ways to create a 
            <br>relationship with their players as well as the constant life-related lessons I deliver 
            <br>through my coaching clinics and private mentorship sessions.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a result over the past several years I have created a Systematic Online Curriculum 
            <br>created to satisfy the needs of players, coaches and parents for every level of play 
            <br>starting at ground zero and guiding them along to the (hopeful) professional ranks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although I still travel the world extensively I now host players and coaches at my 
            <br>headquarters in Kigali Rwanda, for private training and mentorship. Most recently,
            <br>I opened a division of Ganon Baker Basketball where I have partnered with Spartans 
            <br>Academy a basketball education company based in Kigali. Together we have committed 
            <br>to educating coaches, trainers and players in the emerging Rwandan basketball market.
